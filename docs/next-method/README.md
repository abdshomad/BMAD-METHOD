# NEXT-METHOD‚Ñ¢ Documentation

Welcome to the NEXT-METHOD documentation folder! This directory contains all the documentation, guides, and resources for NEXT-METHOD - the intelligent wrapper around BMAD-METHOD that provides an iterative, guided development experience.

## üìö Documentation Files

### Core Documentation

- **[next-method-documentation.md](./next-method-documentation.md)** - Complete user guide and reference
- **[next-method-implementation.md](./next-method-implementation.md)** - Technical implementation summary

### Tools and Examples

- **[demo-next-workflow.sh](./demo-next-workflow.sh)** - Demonstration script showing the iterative workflow

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Read the Overview**: Start with [next-method-documentation.md](./next-method-documentation.md)
2. **Try the Demo**: Run `./demo-next-workflow.sh` to see the workflow in action
3. **Check Implementation**: Review [next-method-implementation.md](./next-method-implementation.md) for technical details

## üéØ What is NEXT-METHOD?

NEXT-METHOD transforms BMAD-METHOD from a manual command-selection tool into an intelligent, guided development assistant. Instead of manually choosing which tasks or commands to run, you simply type `next` repeatedly, and the system intelligently suggests and executes the next appropriate step.

### Key Benefits

- **Reduced Cognitive Load** - No need to remember what to do next
- **Guided Development** - System suggests logical next steps
- **Context Awareness** - Remembers progress and adapts suggestions
- **Faster Workflow** - Less time deciding, more time doing
- **Full BMAD Access** - All existing features preserved

## üîÑ The "Next" Workflow

```bash
# Start the process
next

# Continue with next suggestion
next

# Keep going...
next

# See all options
next --suggest

# Auto-execute next step
next --auto
```
